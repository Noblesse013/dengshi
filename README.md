### Dengshi AI - A GeoGuessr-Inspired Dengue Prevention Web App**

#### **Project Overview**
Dengshi is a gamified web application inspired by GeoGuessr, designed to tackle dengue outbreaks in Bangladesh. Players explore locations, guess mosquito-prone areas, and contribute by capturing real-time images of potential dengue hotspots. These contributions are analyzed using a machine learning model trained on 107 images through Teachable Machine. The app also provides real-time preventive measures to users based on identified risks.

#### **Key Features**
1. **GeoGuessr-Inspired Gameplay**:
   - Players guess locations in Bangladesh prone to mosquitoes.
   - Earn points and extra lives through accurate guesses and contributions.

2. **Real-Time Image Contribution**:
   - Players can capture and upload images of damp areas or stagnant water when their lives run out.
   - Images are analyzed to predict dengue hotspots.

3. **AI-Powered Analysis**:
   - Uses a Teachable Machine pre-trained model to classify images for dengue-prone elements.
   - Identifies areas with stagnant water, damp walls, and other mosquito-breeding indicators.

4. **Dengue Prevention Measures**:
   - Provides real-time preventive tips tailored to identified risks in a userâ€™s area.
   - Aggregates data for city corporations to assist in proactive measures.

5. **Leaderboard and Rewards**:
   - Gamified leaderboard to encourage contributions.
   - Players earn badges and extra lives for consistent participation.

#### **Dependencies**
```json
{
  "type": "commonjs",
  "dependencies": {
    "@teachablemachine/image": "^0.8.5",
    "@tensorflow/tfjs": "^4.22.0",
    "firebase": "^11.2.0",
    "next": "^15.1.5",
    "react": "^19.0.0",
    "react-dom": "^19.0.0"
  }
}
```

#### **Setup Instructions**
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-repo-name>.git
   cd dengshi
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then, run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set Up Firebase**:
   - Create a Firebase project on the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
   - Enable Authentication, Firestore, and Cloud Storage.
   - Add your Firebase config in `src/firebase-config.js`:
     ```javascript
     const firebaseConfig = {
       apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
       authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
       projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
       storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
       messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
       appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
     };
     export default firebaseConfig;
     ```

4. **Integrate Teachable Machine Model**:
   - Export your trained Teachable Machine model and upload it to Firebase Cloud Storage.
   - Use TensorFlow.js to load and run the model in the app:
     ```javascript
     import * as tmImage from '@teachablemachine/image';

     const loadModel = async () => {
       const modelURL = '/path/to/teachable-machine/model.json';
       const metadataURL = '/path/to/teachable-machine/metadata.json';
       const model = await tmImage.load(modelURL, metadataURL);
       return model;
     };
     ```

5. **Run the App**:
   Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Deploy to Firebase**:
   ```bash
   firebase deploy
   ```

#### **How It Works**
1. **Gameplay**:
   - Players guess mosquito-prone locations and earn points for correct answers.
   - When lives run out, they are prompted to capture and upload images of potential hotspots.

2. **Image Analysis**:
   - Uploaded images are processed using the Teachable Machine model to detect elements like stagnant water or damp areas.
   - Results are stored in Firestore for analysis and shared with city corporations.

3. **Preventive Measures**:
   - The app displays dengue prevention tips based on identified risks (e.g., use mosquito nets, avoid standing water).

4. **Community Impact**:
   - Aggregated data predicts mosquito hotspots 3-4 months in advance.
   - Reports are shared with city corporations for proactive action.
